Today I gave a talk along side Pavel Dovbush at ([#jsconfeu](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jsconfeu "Search Twitter for jsconfeu")) about our experiences building a cross platform api abstraction based on protobuf.

I'm attaching the slides [here]({{page.filesdir}}/JSON_RPC.pdf "Building a maintainable bi-directional cross platform protocol"), for those who are interested.

Keep a look out for a further post about the conference and the some thoughts about some of the other awesome presentations.
